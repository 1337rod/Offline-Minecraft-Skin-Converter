# Offline Minecraft Skin Converter

This is a web tool that allows you to generate a Minecraft Java Edition Resource Pack with your custom PNG skin. All processing is performed **locally in your browser**, ensuring complete privacy and offline functionality.

The generated Resource Pack replaces **all** 9 default Minecraft skins (Steve, Alex, Ari, Kai, Noor, Sunny, Zuri, Efe, Makena) with your personalized skin.

## How To Use

1.  Access the project's page (GitHub Pages).
2.  Drag and drop your PNG skin file (64x64) or click to select it.
3.  Click the "DOWNLOAD" button.
4.  The `skin_pack.zip` file will be downloaded.
5.  Place the `skin_pack.zip` file into your Minecraft `resourcepacks` folder and activate it in-game.

## Generated Pack Structure

The ZIP file contains the minimum structure required to function as a skin Resource Pack.

**Enjoy!** :)
